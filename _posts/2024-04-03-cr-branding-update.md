We just went through with a full branding refresh of ScytedTV, which calls for some of our older show branding designs to get refreshed too.

As you guys are aware, I am working on a game show called "Clever Remarks", "The Game Show where we answer some of the world's silliest questions.". We started adding branding images on all ScytedTV platforms to let everyone know that a new show was coming this year. Those branding images lacked depth and character, so I'ved updated them. This was perfect because I needed to update them anyways for the new ScytedTV logo.

These changes aren't that dramatic by any means, but the team has agreed that it is much better than before.

Below are all of the old and new images that you can check out!

## Twitter Banner

My personal favourite transformation from this refresh (and no, I will not call Twitter "X").

Since Clever Remarks Season 1 is currently in post-production, we are now able to start casting for the second season of the show. More information will be coming as we start to cast this next season. If you are interested in being on the show, please reach out at <a href="mailto:casting@scyted.tv">casting@scyted.tv</a>, or any other route such as Casting Call Club, contacting Loyd, etc.

## Show Description:

The contestants of Clever Remarks are given a series of random questions that don't always make sense - or sometimes make too much sense - and it is their job to answer them and argue why their answer is correct over the answers of the other contestant.

In between each round there will be minigames that will grant extra points to the players. The final round of the game includes some opinion-based questions that are sometimes controversial (not counting towards any points) to spark some debate.

## Requirements:
- Must use a camera and microphone.
- Must be okay with using your legal First and Last Name.
- Must have Discord for recording and planning.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: Is this a paid project?**
<br>
A: No, it is not. Our Studio does not have any source of income at the moment and cannot pay anyone. Everone is purely here on a volunteer basis and doing it for fun, experience, or for portfolio material.
<br><br>

**Q: How is it recorded?**
<br>
A: We record it in a Discord VC with our Cameras and Microphones on. We have someone in the VC (usually an Editor or Producer) recording it on their end making sure we can get a decent quality recording.
<br><br>

**Q: Do I *have* to use my Legal First and Last Name?**
<br>
A: We do allow you to use a preferred first name if you have one, although other names need to be approved. On occasion, we are known to make exceptions, but we have some very strict guidelines for using another name. Just ask a producer and we might be willing to make an exception. We make exceptions on a case-by-case basis.
<br><br>

**Q: Do I *have* to use my Camera?**
<br>
A: Yes, you do. We are considering alternatives such as VTubers and self-animated characters, but we have no timeline on when this might be allowed, if at all. Things like masks or other face coverings that make it difficult to see you are also no allowed. Religious or other belief-based coverings will be allowed as long as it doesn't interfere with the flow of the show (like making it impossible to see or hear you at all).
<br><br>

**Q: Is the show NSFW?**
<br>
A: For comedy value, some of the questions we ask can be NSFW; although some more than others. If you don't want to swear or are uncomfortable with anything NSFW, we can accomodate and put you in an episode where all of the NSFW questions have been removed.
<br><br>

**Q: When will my episode be release?**
<br>
A: Whenever the rest of the season is finished. We will keep you updated on any important things, as well as provide you with private previews of your episode when it is in the final stages of post-production, in which case you can provide feedback and recommend changes.

Hello all!

We need writers for our news show ScytedTV News! As a writer, you'll be working with our team to make well-made scripts about popular internet, gaming, and anime news. We have a few requirements as you will see below! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

- 16 years or older.
- We want people who can remain neutral on a range of topics. Even if you are biased and have your opinions we ask that you keep them out of the script. Because it is a news show and we want it to be informative. Joking in the scripts is ok, we just want neutrality.
- This job is unpaid at the moment, but that will change in the future.
- Must have Discord for communication (please include in your audition).

If youâ€™re worried about the script not being good enough, don't be! We can help you out or help enhance your writing. Please submit even if you aren't confident.

## Roles

**Writer:**

Please write a script about anything that interests you that is internet, gaming or anime related. (For example : Like a new season of an anime comes out that you like, or a game you like got a cool update.) Using a similar format to any of the news stories in the video linked above! Also please include your Discord username in your application (not your display name - your username). ! If you don't feel comfortable with putting it on here, send it to our messages!

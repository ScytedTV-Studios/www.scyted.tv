## Show Description:

The contestants of Clever Remarks are given a series of random questions that don't always make sense - or sometimes make too much sense - and it is their job to answer them and argue why their answer is correct over the answers of the other contestants.

In between each round there will be minigames that will grant extra points to the players. The final round of the game includes some opinion-based questions that are sometimes controversial (not counting towards any points) to spark some debate.

## Requirements:
- Must use a camera and microphone.
- Must be okay with using your legal first and last name for crediting (if you would like us to make an exception, please let us know the reason why and we might grant exceptions).

## Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: Is this a paid project?**
<br>
A: No, it is not. Our Studio does not have any source of income at the moment and cannot pay anyone. Everone is purely here on a volunteer basis and doing it for fun, experience, or for portfolio material.
<br><br>

**Q: How is it recorded?**
<br>
A: We record it in a Discord VC with our Cameras and Microphones on. We have someone in the VC (usually an Editor or Producer) recording it on their end making sure we can get a decent quality recording.
<br><br>

**Q: Do I *have* to use my Legal First and Last Name?**
<br>
A: We do allow you to use a preferred first name if you have one, although other names need to be approved. On occasion, we are known to make exceptions, but we have some very strict guidelines for using another name. Just ask a producer and we might be willing to make an exception. We make exceptions on a case-by-case basis.
<br><br>

**Q: Do I *have* to use my Camera?**
<br>
A: Yes, you do. We are considering alternatives such as VTubers and self-animated characters, but we have no timeline on when this might be allowed, if at all.
<br><br>

**Q: Is the show NSFW?**
<br>
A: For comedy value, some of the questions we ask can be NSFW; although some more than others. If you don't want to swear or are uncomfortable with anything NSFW, we can accomodate and put you in an episode where all of the NSFW questions have been removed.
<br><br>

**Q: When will my episode be release?**
<br>
A: Whenever the rest of the season is finished. We will keep you updated on any important things, as well as provide you with private previews of your episode when it is in the final stages of post-production, in which case you can provide feedback and recommend changes.

Yesterday, we created a fake rebrand as a joke for April Fools. If you were there to see it, you would know how bad it was. Obviously we aren't rebranding to that. Instead, we still want to do a rebrand, but one that actually looks better and fits our style. This rebrand will take us awhile to apply across all of our platforms, but we will get there slowly, but surely.

The main reason why we decided to do this rebrand was because of the font we used to use. The old font didn't really look that great and it caused problems while scaling its size. Additionally, it doesn't really fit the style we're going for anymore. The goal with this brand refresh it to bring a modern style to our studio while maintaining a friendly feel.

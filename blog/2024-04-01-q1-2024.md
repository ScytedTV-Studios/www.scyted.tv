Hello everyone! This is [Loyd Osborne](https://www.scyted.tv/team/), Founder and CEO of ScytedTV Studios. I'm here to give the first quarterly report of 2024, also happening to be the first one we've ever done. I'll be covering everything from before 2024 up until now. But first, let's start with a little bit about me and my goals for ScytedTV.

ScytedTV has been around since August 16th, 2022. I'll be honest, we've done a lot, but not as much as I wish we did in the last 2 and half years. After all, I am a full-time high school student graduating this June, so I have to work with the extra time I have. After High School, my plan is to focus more on the studio and get a part-time job to start covering for the expenses of some of our shows.

My goal is to have released the a new or the first season of 2-4 more ScytedTV Original shows, including my upcoming show "[Clever Remarks](https://www.scyted.tv/show/clever-remarks)" by the end of 2024, leading into 2025. This will definitely be a challenge with our limited team members, but it won't stop us from trying!

Ever since the beginning, we have functioned purely on a volunteer basis, and we honestly couldn't do it without everyone who has helped. With that, I would personally like to thank ALL of the following people (this is going to be a long list). Here it is the list in alphabetical order:

> AdmiralTrina, Aja Pryor, Annabelle McIlwain, Bea Cifra, Camille Castermant, Chea Kwang-ho, Cheyenne Daisey, Christian Shooks, Cody Brown, Connor Tompkins, Corey, Dominic Evans, Dylan Smith, Emmalee Phair, Hadrian Haslam, Hollie Malcolm, Jela Francis, Jeremy Pfeiffer, Jonathon Reed, Joseph Robertson, Kamalarajah Punitharajah, Katie Stepp, Katie Goodfellow, Landon, Leah, Leevi Gunnels, Lily Robertson, Mansell Haslam, Milo, Nia Louise, Niall Daly, Olivia Alvarez, Persephone Quill, Quinn, Rebecca Goulty, Rose O'sullivan, Rozhina Tajmirriahi, Yaman Ahmad, Zay Wilson.

And I'm sure there are more, but I honestly can't find them all. So thank you all for everything you've done to help ScytedTV, I appreciate it more than you know. If I'm missing anyone, PLEASE let me know so I can update it, because I want to make sure everyone is listed.

## 2022:

**The EEF Project**

During 2022, we released our very first special titled "[10 Years of CrankGameplays](https://youtu.be/uey792NfJf0)" in appreciation of [Ethan Nestor](https://www.youtube.com/@ethan) (formerly CrankGameplays) and his work over the last 10 (now almost 12) years on YouTube. This video has amassed 1,214 views since it was released, with him also watching it live to thousands of viewers on his [10 year anniversary stream](https://youtu.be/ArnKJoT_GI4). Later that same day, he released his video ALSO titled "[10 Years of CrankGameplays](https://youtu.be/VrTKW-Qmlb0)", which we were not expecting.

In October of 2022 on his birthday, we created another short appreciation video for him titled "[It's His Birthday](https://youtu.be/hGZL2jvWN1M)", which has gotten 132 views since it was released. This makes sense since the video was only 50 seconds.

## 2023:

**YouTube Gameshow**

In February of 2023, we released our very first original series titled "[YouTube Gameshow](https://www.scyted.tv/show/youtube-gameshow)", which has now been archived. This was originally released on the host's YouTube channel and is still available there to this day. You can also watch the show on its show page here: [scyted.tv/show/youtube-gameshow](https://www.scyted.tv/show/youtube-gameshow)

**Inside Mind**

Skipping ahead to June 3rd of 2023, I released the first ever episode of my podcast, "[Inside Mind](https://www.scyted.tv/show/inside-mind)". The first season only lasted 3 episodes, featuring Jonathon Reed in episode one, Bea Cifra in episode two, and Emmalee Phair in episode three. We do plan to produce another season of the show at some point, but we don't have a timeline of when that is going to happen.

**Streaming Service**

Also during 2023, we tested out the concept of a streaming service in August, but that only lasted until November 18th when it shut down for good and we released this website about a month later.

**A New Era**

In September, I started realizing that I couldn't do this alone, so I started looking for new team members on [Casting Call Club](https://www.castingcall.club/). Eventually, I met [Jeremy](https://www.scyted.tv/team/) who premiered his show "[Ink & Ideals](https://www.scyted.tv/show/ink-and-ideals)" to ScytedTV in October, and he brought in Landon who premiered his sketch-comedy series, "[Landor's Shorts](https://www.scyted.tv/show/landors-shorts)" in late November.

During this time, I started developing departements within ScytedTV: Production (ran by [Camille Castermant](https://www.scyted.tv/team/)), Creative (ran by Cody Brown), Content (ran by [Jeremy Pfeiffer](https://www.scyted.tv/team/)), Talent, and Community (both ran by me at the time). Our goal with creating these departements was to have dedicated teams of people who focused on different elements of our productions, basically passing our shows from departement to departement depending on what stage of production the show was in.

After some time of using that system, we noticed that there were some issues with that original concept, because it's not that easy to just pass it on to a different team of people. Instead, we opted for a per-show team where we would have a team of people for each show that would all work together on the show, rather than it being passed between departements. This helped us streamline our processes better, because we didn't have to worry about all of the extra communication between departements to pass things around, because everyone was on the same team and could just ask someone to do whatever was needed of them.

## This Quarter:

That brings us to 2024, where we are now actively producting 5 shows: [ScytedTV News](https://www.scyted.tv/show/scytedtv-news) and [Ink & Ideals](https://www.scyted.tv/show/ink-and-ideals) (produced by [Jeremy](https://www.scyted.tv/team/)), and [Clever Remarks](https://www.scyted.tv/show/clever-remarks) and [Milo's Life](https://www.scyted.tv/show/milos-life) (Produced by [me](https://www.scyted.tv/team/) and [Camille](https://www.scyted.tv/team/)), and a 5th show with a currently-undecided name by Christian Shooks.

Shows such as [Ink & Ideals](https://www.scyted.tv/show/ink-and-ideals), and [ScytedTV News](https://www.scyted.tv/show/scytedtv-news) are released whenever new episodes are ready. [Milo's Life](https://www.scyted.tv/show/milos-life) is released weekly on Friday's at 4pm PST / 7pm EST, and [Clever Remarks](https://www.scyted.tv/show/clever-remarks) will begin releasing regular episodes every other week at some point in 2024, with behind the scenes videos every *other other* week.

During this quarter, I started enforcing the policy of "Quality over Quantity". I realized that we were pushing too much for regular uploads to our channels, causing for some uploads that weren't high quality, or were heavily rushed. Instead, I shifted the focus to creating a smaller roster of high-quality and long-term shows that wouldn't released until they were completed. We wouldn't rush these shows to release, they would be scheduled when they were finished; an example being [Clever Remarks](https://www.scyted.tv/show/clever-remarks), which won't get a release date until we have completed post-production.

Another change I made was the 

__Checklist of items to include:__
- The team changes to switch to dedicated show teams instead of departments. [ADDED]
- Switching shows to their own dedicated channels instead of having them all on the main one.
- The switch to a focus on quality, rather than quantity. [ADDED]

## The Future:

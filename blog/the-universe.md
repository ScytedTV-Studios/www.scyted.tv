*We have a pre-recorded story for the first season and we need some writers to help take this pre-recorded audio and write it into a script so we can get proper voice actors to record the lines.*

## Show Description:

The Universe is a complicated storytelling adventure that houses complex stories that take place amongst multiple universes and character sets. Each story collapses within itself to create a beautiful symphony of chaos and memories that listeners will never forget. Our goal is to teach people lessons about the world and what it is to be human with out-of-this-world story design that realistically encapsulates the beauty of the human mind and its struggles.

> *Our first story lands us in a never-before-seen universe where "Character" (aka "Player") finds themselves longing for their now-deceased husband. They're trying to figure out what happened to him, whist also trying to find out how they can see him again. In doing so, player meets the original narrator of The Universe who reluctantly helps player by bringing them back to their lover.*

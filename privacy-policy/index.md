# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 13, 2024**

Thank you for using [scyted.tv](https://www.scyted.tv/) ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our website, Discord Bots, and Activities.

## 1. Information We Collect:

We do not collect any personal information when you use our website. All user data related to Discord login is stored locally in your browser's cookies. We do not have access to, nor do we store, any personal information on our servers.

However, when using our Discord Bots and Activities, we collect basic information such as your Discord User ID, Username, and other public Discord data. This information is necessary for the functionality of our Bots and Activities and is used solely for that purpose.

## 2. How We Use Your Information:

For website usage, we do not collect personal information, and therefore do not use your information for any purpose. When using our Discord Bots and Activities, the collected data is used to enable and enhance bot functionality and user interaction within Discord.

## 3. Cookies:

We use cookies to store user session data locally on your device. This data is used for authentication purposes when interacting with Discord services. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings.

## 4. Third-Party Services:

Our website may use third-party services for analytics or other functionalities. These services may have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## 5. Data Availability:

User information related to public bot data, such as your current level on "Levlr," may be available publicly via our API. Please note that any data stored or displayed publicly is not considered personal or private information as anyone can view it by using a command on Discord.

## 6. Data Security:

We take reasonable steps to protect the information we collect. However, since we do not store personal information related to website usage, the risk of data breach is minimized. Discord bot data is handled with care to maintain security and integrity.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy:

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the date of the last update will be indicated.

## 8. Contact Information:

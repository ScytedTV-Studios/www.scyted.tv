<h2>Discontinuation of Wave 24/7</h2>

<br>

<h6>It is with a heavy heart that I have decided to discontinue Wave 24/7 due to a few factors:</h6>

<li>The bot has a lot of issues with it causing it to crash more often than it should due to sloppy coding.</li>
<li>I don't have a lot of time to maintain the bot anymore. I started it as a fun little side project, and it grew - which is cool - but I cannot maintain it to the standards I want.</li>
<li>The bot consistently hits 100 servers (I keep purging inactive servers), and Discord still hasn't responded to my bot verification ticket after months of waiting.</li>

<br><br>

<h6>What does this mean for Wave Development?</h6>

<li>Wave Development isn't going anywhere. I still have some other bots like "Levlr" and "Heart Collectors" that I still update occasionally.</li>
<li>The name "Wave Development" was originally created for Wave 24/7, so it doesn't really make sense to keep it as such. It will be changed (at some point) to "ScytedTV Development" - a branch of "ScytedTV Studios", my media studio.</li>
<li>I am working on transferring all of Wave Development's website resources over to the website for my other company, "ScytedTV Studios". All bot information and access to APIs and such will slowly become available here: <a href="https://www.scyted.tv/resources/">https://www.scyted.tv/resources/</a></li>

<br><br>

<h6>When is "Wave 24/7" and "Wave Two" being discontinued?</h6>

<li>The bot will officially be going offline on March 9, 2024 12:00 PM (Mountain Standard Time). The bots will continue to function normally, but will go offline on that date and time.</li>
<li>There is also a chance that it will be brought back in the future at some point.</li>

<br><br>

Either way, it was a fun ride and I'm happy I got the chance to experiment with Music bots. If it makes a return in the future, I will be recoding the entire bot to include a bunch of the recommended features.

<br><br>

For now though, that isn't the end from me. I am still here working on new projects and stuff. Keep an eye out for new things in the Discord Server.

<br><br>

Thanks,
<br>
Loyd
